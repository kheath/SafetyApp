Master repository for the CS121 Safety App

Overview:

    This Android app was developed for a college-level programming
course.  The purpose of this app is to provide a quick method of
communicating the user's GPS location to a predetermined associate.
If the user finds him/herself in an uncomfortable situation, this app
provides a means to quickly communicate this to a friend.  Note that
this app only works on Android phones with texting services.

This code was developed by Kevin Heath, Kilian Fa, and Heiwon Yoon
for CS 121 Software Development at Harvey Mudd College.

The idea for this Android app belongs to November Baez Trejo, Brenda
Garcia, Sara Shi, and Kevin Wynn.

The primary classes for this app reside in:
/SafetyApp/SMSMessaging/app/src/main/java/myfirstapp/example/com/sms

The associated tests are in a subfolder of the previous directory.

Other resources can be found in:
